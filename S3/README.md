# Session 3 -Face Recognition Part 1 - Face Detection, Face Alignment, Face Swap

## Objective

In this assignment, we have to create and deploy the following models on AWS Lambda and create a static website on AWS S3 for the users to interact with the trained models.:

- ResNet-34 model pre-trained on the imagenet dataset
- MobileNet v2 pretrained model on the imagenet dataset
- Custom MobileNetV2 model trained in the [last](https://github.com/shan18/EVA4-Phase-2/tree/master/02%20-%20MobileNet) assignment to classify objects belonging to a custom dataset containing following classes
  - Flying Bird
  - Large Quadcopter
  - Small Quadcopter
  - Winged Drones
- Face Detection
- Face Alignment
- Face Swap

All the files and the models have to be deployed to AWS Lambda. The code to deploy them can be found [here](deployment/).
