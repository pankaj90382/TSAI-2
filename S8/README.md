# Session 8 - Image Super-Resolution and Neural Style Transfer

## Image Super-Resolution

The goal of this assignment is to create an interactive website that increase the resolution of a low resolution image.

All the files and the models have to be deployed to AWS Lambda. The code to deploy them can be found [here](srgan/).

### Parameters and Hyperparameters

- Loss Function: Combination of Adversarial, Perception, TV and Mean Square Error loss
- Epochs: 30
- Optimizer: Adam
- Batch Size: 64
- Upscale Factor: 4

### Results

All the results and code deployment can be found [here](srgan/).

## Neural Style Transfer

Neural style transfer is an artificial system based on a Deep Neural Network that creates artistic images of high perceptual quality. The system uses neural representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images, providing a neural algorithm for the creation of artistic images.

All the files and the models have to be deployed to AWS Lambda. The code to deploy them can be found [here](neural_style/).
